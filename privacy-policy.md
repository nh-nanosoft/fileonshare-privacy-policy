# Privacy Policy for FileOnShare
**Effective Date:** [October 7, 2024]

Thank you for using FileOnShare. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information related to the App. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices.

## Information We Collect
FileOnShare does not collect or store any personal information from its users. The App functions entirely offline for file sharing, and no user data is transmitted or stored by the App.
However, the App integrates with Google services that may collect certain data:

- **Google AdMob:** The App uses Google AdMob to serve ads. AdMob may collect and use data to display personalised ads. You can review Google's privacy policy to learn more about their data collection practices.

- **Firebase Analytics:** The App uses Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous data related to app usage, such as app interactions and performance data. This helps us improve the App experience. Firebase Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information.

- **Firebase Crashlytics:** The App uses Google Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports. Crashlytics helps identify technical issues by gathering anonymized crash data, which we use to improve the stability and performance of the App. This data does not include personally identifiable information.

## Data Use
While FileOnShare itself does not collect any personal data, Google services like AdMob, Firebase Analytics, and Firebase Crashlytics may collect data as per their policies. Any data collected by these services is used for:
- Displaying ads relevant to users (Google AdMob)
- Monitoring app performance and user behaviour (Firebase Analytics)
- Reporting and fixing app crashes (Firebase Crashlytics)

## Data Sharing
We do not share any personal information with third parties, except for the data collected through AdMob and Firebase, which is governed by their privacy policies. You can find more details in their respective policies.

## Children's Privacy
FileOnShare does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If you believe that we have unintentionally collected such data, please contact us, and we will delete it promptly.

## Your Choices
You have control over your data:
You can opt out of personalised ads by adjusting your device's advertising settings or through Google's ad settings

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, regulatory, or operational reasons. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.
